## Introduction

* The University of Groningen's Masters thesis explores communication and collaboration between humans and robots in physical collaborative transportation tasks in dynamic environments.
* The study proposes using physical gestures as a means of communication to enhance collaboration between humans and robots during carrying tasks.
* The purpose of the study is to improve task efficiency and reliability by proposing an effective communication channel between humans and robots during collaborative carrying tasks.
* The study presents an innovative gesture recognition technology to enhance communication in human-robot collaboration.
* The proposed communication channel has potential applications in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics.
