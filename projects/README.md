Here you can find the overview for all my documented projects.

The **first heading contains notes divided by subject topic**. These description contain basic definitions and personal notes to review when working on the same topics in the future. 

The **remainder of the page divides the projects by subjects**, giving brief but detailed description of the decisions made to implement the code and the conclusion for each experiment.

Jupyter notebook code for all projects can be found in respective repositories on [Github](https://github.com/ASBattu?tab=repositories).


This page is still unifinished and projects will be added once fully documented.
